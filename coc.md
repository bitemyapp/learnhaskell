# Code of conduct

[See Chris Done's post on teaching](http://chrisdone.com/posts/teaching)

Be kind and courteous. Being mean or rude scares people off and makes people not want to participate.

Low-effort criticism is for the benefit of the person delivering it, not the person receiving it.

Don't describe things as "easy" or "trivial". You'll making people feel terrible for having to work hard for their progress. Slow learners are often the most thorough learners, this is something to celebrate!

No feigning surprise. Don't act surprised when somebody says they don't know something. They'll feel terrible and you've accomplished nothing except to make yourself feel sharp.

No well-actually's. When someone says something that's almost - but not entirely - correct, and you say, "well, actually…" and then give a minor correction. This is especially annoying when the correction has no bearing on the actual conversation. This doesn't mean #haskell-beginners isn't about truth-seeking or that we don't care about being precise. Almost all well-actually's are about grandstanding, not truth-seeking.

No back-seat driving. If you see people working through a problem, you shouldn't intermittently interject advice. Let them work it out unless someone asks for help. Avoiding interruptions is [one of the founding purposes of #haskell-beginners](http://chrisdone.com/posts/teaching). 

No subtle -isms. Racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, and other kinds of bias are not welcome and will not be tolerated.
